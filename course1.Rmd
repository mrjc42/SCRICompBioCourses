Welcome to the introductory course for computer resources here at SCRI.  This course will cover a basic introduction to the SCRI Citrix environment and also will introduce you to basic tools in linux.  If you have a bad case of CLAS (command line aversion syndrome), then this course should help you get on the road to recovery.


Here is a list of topics that should be covered by the end of this course:

# Introduction to Citrix

# Introduction to Linux: 

### What is Linux?  

Linux is a free open sourced operating system based on Unix.  It's technically not unix, but in practice it might as well be.  Unix is a dinosaur of the computer world and has been around forever.  The reason it's still here is because it works really well and people still find it quite useful today.

### How is it organized?  

There are many flavors of unix, but most of them have the same basic directory structure.  You don't need to know about a lot of it in order to use it.  But you should know a couple of things.  The 1st is that the root directory is the base for the whole system.  Unless you are the system admin or are installing software or something, you probably don't belong down there.  More commonly you want to be in your home directory.  Your home is at ~/  We will talk more about this is a minute.

### Why do people use it?

People like unix because it is powerful and flexible tool for efficiently getting certain kinds of work done.  This is especially true for work that has never been done before or that requires the creation of customized work flows.  If this sounds familiar that's because this is the same kind of work that people often need to do to manage data in science.  And this is why so many scientists have found linux to be a useful platform for developing new work flows.  Everyone agrees that graphical interfaces can be nice.  But the odds that you will find one that already does exactly what your experiment needs get vanishingly small starting with the moment you do anything interesting.


# Introduction to the command line: 


### What is tab-completion?

Before you type anything, please locate the tab key in the upper left part of your keyboard. You are going to be hitting that key a lot. That is because in Linux if you start to type something, even it you only know the first letter, you can hit the tab key for suggestions about what should come next. Go ahead and try it!  Type 'pw' and then hit the tab key for suggestions about what we might do next...


### pwd, / and ~/

This is how you know where you are:

```{}
pwd
```

'pwd' means print working directory.  It will tell you where in the file system you are by giving you the full path starting with root.


The root of a unix filesystem always starts with '/'.  So when you run 'pwd', you will alway state your current path relative to root.  '~/' is shorthand for your home directory.  But if you go to your home directory, you will be able to see the full absolute path by using 'pwd'.

### Directories, executables and files

Directories are for storing stuff, executables do things to stuff and files are stuff.  In Linux a full directory path will start with root and end with another '/' and use more '/'s in between as separators for each subdirectory.  On most command lines directories will be colored to indicate that they are different from the files.  And in linux most executables are stored somewhere else, so you won't normally see those unless you are invoking them as commands.


### cd, . and ..

'cd' means change directory.  You call that command followed by a single argument to indicate which directory you want to change to.  

'.' means here.  You use it to indicate that the path to something is where you are right now.  

And '..' means one directory up from here.


### ls

'ls' is used to list a directory.  Which directory does it list?  That would be the second argument.  For example, the following command would list the contents of the root directory

```{}
ls /
```

And this would list the current directory.
```{}
ls .
```

But in practice when people want to list the current directory, they leave out the implicit '.' like so:
```{}
ls
```

And when I use this command, it tends to look like this:
```{}
ls -alh
```
Which translates to: list the directory, but list all the files (even hidden ones), and use the long format, and make the sizes human readable.  How did I ever learn to do that?


### What are permissions?

Another thing you might have noticed about my longer form use of 'ls' is that it puts a string of characters in from of each file and directory.  Lets look at a toy example:

```{}
-rw-r--r-- 1 username rleQAS_SCRI-Sudo 8.2K Oct  7 17:21 file.txt
```

Permssions are used by Linux to control who can do things. They can be applied to (u)sers, (g)roups, (o)thers, or (a)ll.  (u)sers means the user who owns (created) the file while (g)roups mean the group that the file belongs to, and (o)thers means people who are not in these first two categories.  In Linux everything belongs to someone, so ownership and permission to act accordingly is a big deal.  Also true in Linux, is that groups of users are tracked and assigned to each file.  But each of these categories (user, group or other) can have separate permissions set to control whether people are allowed to (r)ead, (w)rite or e(x)ecute them.  Returning back to the mysterious string of ten characters mentioned above, it is actually broken into 4 sections: 

1) The very first character doesn't actually have to do with permissions.  It just indicates the kind of thing that something is. For example if it starts with 'd', then it's a directory etc.  In general, you won't need to spend a lot of time thinking about this first character.
2) The next three characters: indicate the (r)ead, (w)rite and e(x)ecute policy for the (u)ser
3) The next three characters: indicate the (r)ead, (w)rite and e(x)ecute policy for the (g)roup
4) The last three characters: indicate the (r)ead, (w)rite and e(x)ecute policy for the (o)thers

Based on this, we can see that for the file above the permissions are set to be readable and writable for the owner of this file, but only readable by others.  If you ever need to change the permissions on a file, you would do that by using the 'chmod' command.  Also, you may not be allowed to change permissions for some files and directories depending on who they belong to and what kind of access priveleges you have.



### man

Well I used the man command to learn more about 'ls'.  You can use the man command to pull up a manual about any linux command like this:

```{}
man ls
```

When you are done looking at it, hit the 'q' key.

### mkdir

Sometimes you will need to make a new directory.  For that there is the mkdir command.
```{}
mkdir myDir
```

### touch

And sometimes you will just need to create an empty file.  Maybe later on you want to write something to it, but right now you just want to reserve that filename.  For that you can use the 'touch' command.  Here we use touch to create a file inside of our new directory:

```{}
touch myDir/test.txt
```

### text editors

Linux is rife with powerful text editors.  Some of them (like vi or emacs) are so powerful that they could each have their own course.  Today lets look at a very simple and common one: 'nano'.

```{}
nano myFile.txt
```

That command will launch the nano editor.  Once inside you will be able to type in text of interest.  When you want to leave you can look at the bottom of the screen and you will see commands abbreviated like this: ^X 

^X means 'control-X'.  It's a hint about how to give that command.  Do it now to exit out of nano and feel free to save your work on the way.


### less is more

Sometimes less is more.  And when you are using linux suddenly 'less' literally is a more advanced version of the 'more' command.  The 'more' command was long used for looking at large text files.  And 'less' does the same basic job as 'more'.  So now that you know that, you should expect that the following command will let you look at the file 'myFile.txt':

```{}
less myFile.txt
```

And when you were done you could exit by again pressing 'q'.  Why the similarity to 'man'?  Because man is actually using 'less' to display the contents of the manual pages.  It's not the only time you will see that happen either.  Tools in Linux gets reused a lot.

### cp, mv and rm

'cp' copies a file to another place.  'mv' moves a file (and so does not leave the original behind).  Here is an example of each of these:

```{}
cp file.txt filecopy.txt
mv file.txt ..
```

The first of these commands copies 'file.txt' to another file with a different name 'filecopy.txt' in the same directory.  The second command moves file.txt up a directory from where it is currently located.

But sometimes you just want to get rid of something altogether.  'rm' will do that for you.  Here is an example that just removed file.txt:

```{}
rm file.txt
```

Another common case with rm is when you have a directory and you want to remove it AND everything in it  When that happens you can tell rm to remove things recursively like this:

```{}
rm -r myDir
```

Where myDir and everything in it will be deleted.  Obviously using the -r flag with rm can be dangerous. So be caregful!


### What are wildcards?

In linux you can use '*' as a wildcard to indicate more broadly which things you mean.  So for example, if I have to files that both end with '.txt' then I can move them both into myDir by doing this:

```{}
mv *.txt /myDir
```

Wildcards are useful for a whole host of other circumstances.  But be careful.  If you use them with commands like rm, you might end up wishing that you could rewind time.
 

### cat

Cat is useful for streaming the contents of a file.  As a quick example the following use of cat would dump the contents of 'myFile.txt' to the screen.  So by itself 'cat' is not so useful.

```{}
cat myFile.txt
```

But: the more common use for 'cat' is to send a command to a pipe.  What is a pipe you say?



### What are pipes?

So glad you asked! A pipe is a way of moving data around in unix.  Technically, it is an "operator" (like "+" and "-").  And you use it to indicate something specific that you want to happen between a couple of other things.  Let me give an example to clarify:

```{}
cat myFile.txt | less
```

Here cat is streaming the contents of myFile "in" to a pipe.  Where doed the data go next?  Well in the example above it goes "in" to the less command.  So when you see the '|' operator, what it means is that the output of the thing to it's left is being sent "in" to the thing to it's right.  Just like a pipe would.  

Ok, I will admit that the example above could be a lot more interesting.  Right now you are probably wondering why not just use less on the file like a normal person?  But just wait till we show you some other tricks that you can use with pipe.  I promise we will make this worth your time...


### grep

The grep command is usually used to find strings in text files. For example you could search a file called 'file.txt' for the string 'var' like this:

```{}
grep 'var' file.txt
```




### find



### ps

### top

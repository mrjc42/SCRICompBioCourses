This document expands on some important topics from Course 1 that will be important for you to know as you navigate your way around the linux environment within SCRI. This module will help you understand how the file system is organized, what things you can, cannot, and should not access, and other policies and best practices that will make your life easier as you use these resources.

# Why Linux?

A question that came up and that perhaps you have asked, "Is this really worth it? Why should I invest my time in learning Linux?" The answer to this topic could be a course all by itself. Let us just try to point out what we think are a few of the advantages

* Many of the 'industry standard' tools used to analyze today's data are only available in Linux. GATK, tophat, bwa, cufflinks, samtools, many of these are open source tools that are meant to be distributed for free. These tools aren't readily available outside of the command-line environment

* Fine control. Whenever you make a graphical user interface, it becomes very hard to expose all the options that the program is capable of in an easy way. Therefore, you usually make assumptions and lock in some defaults. At the command-line, you can more easily allow the user to specify parameters and gain fine control of the program.

* Modularity. With a command-line interface, you can string small programs together like legos and build your own custom workflows and programs that work exactly the way you want them to.

* Reproducibility. When you use command-line and/or write scripts, you create a record of exactly what you did to your data. Anytime you re-run the commands you wrote, you will get the same result.

* Speed. In the short-term, it may seem like a huge investement of time and energy to learn how to work in this environement and use these tools. The payoff comes though when you can write scripts to automate many tasks that once required hours of tedious repetition. Also, with linux, you can take better advantage of parallel processing to vastly speed up the processing time.

* Scale. Most of the files that you may encounter, such as fasta, fastq, bam, etc, are enormous. Although they are often just simple text documents, most desktop computers simply can't handle them, so there is no way to open them or even 'take a peak' inside them. Hopefully you have seen how that those simple taskes are quite trivial with linux systems. Dealing with large files and scaling up your analyses are easy for linux.

# The Linux file structure

### Root

If you are used to interfacing with your computer via a graphical user interface such as Finder (Mac) or Windows Explorer (PC), the concept of a __root directory__ may be somewhat vague. The root directory is simply the most inclusive folder on the system, or in other words, the folder that contains all other folders and files. When working with the command line, no matter what system you use, you can designate an absolute path by describing its location relative to root. For Window's users, each disk drive has it's own root, for example `C:`, `D:`, etc. Unix based systems, including Mac OS X and Linux, have a single root designated simply by `/`.

***
####  <span style="color:blue">__Exercise L1:__</span>
* Using the `cd` command, navigate to the root directory. <Hint: the root directory is designated by `/`.
* Using the `ls` command, take a look at the contents of root. Just for fun, try adding the `-a` and `-l` flags, seperately and together. What files do you see? Can you tell if these are actual files or directories?

***

### Common system directories

In the last example, you noticed that there are many directories contained in `root`, and you may wonder what these are for and if they are important to you. Most of these are system directories that are common to nearly every linux OS. __They have specific functions, and unless you really know what they are for and are authorized to change them, it is best to leave these alone.__ To satisfy your curiosity, here is a brief description of some of the common ones:

* __`/bin`__: This directory contains many *binary* files for the common commands such as `ls`, `mv`, `cp`, etc.

* __`/dev`__: This directory contains system files related to any attached *devices*, such as hard drives, dvd drives, modems, speakers, etc.

* __`/etc`__: This stands for *et cetera*. But that doesn't mean that the contents are miscellaneous, although it's likely it once meant that. Now, this drive contains all system related configuration files. It is considered the nerve center of the system.

* __`/home`__: We will talk about *home* later.

* __`/lib`__: This directory contains the system *library*. Libraries are modules of code that provide key functionality. Think of them as mini code repositories.

* __`/usr`__: This directory often contains the largest share of data. `usr` stands for *User System Resources* (not 'User'). This directory contains many more binaries, libraries and configuration files for all the additional, non-system applications that have been installed on the computer.

* __`/tmp`__: This directory contains mostly files that are only required *temporarily*. Just because they are temporary though doesn't mean they aren't important. Many of these files are important for currently running programs and deleting them may result in a system crash.

### Home

__`/home`__ deserves a little special attention. __home__ is not to be confused with __root__. A home directory is merely a default location to store personal account settings and user-specific files. Note however, that home is not root. In linux, your home directory is always located at `/home/username`. Because this is a common stop for so many functions, a convenient short hand is used to designate home: `~/`.

Because `/home` belongs to you, it is one of the few places where you can explore and play around without crashing the system (usually). Because it has a convenient short cut when using `cd`, it is a conveneint place to create links to other locations in your system. It is a very tempting place to set up shop and store all of your data. Afterall, when you first log in to the system, this is where you land. Even in our exercises, we had you start dumping the example files here. Be aware though, that in our system, `/home` is not very big. __You only have 10 GB of space alloted to your `/home` directory.__ For that reason, you really don't want to store your data in `/home`. Below, we will discuss some better alternatives.

***
####  <span style="color:blue">__Exercise L2:__</span>
* Navigate to your home directory using the `cd` command. <Hint: the home directory is given the special designation `~`.>
* Find out how much disk space you are using in your home directory by typing the following command:
```
du -sh
```

### SCRI-specific directories

There are two directories in `root` that are specific to the SCRI environment and that will be key to successfully working with the autobots:

* __`/tools`__ The tools directory contains a collection of bioinformatics related applications, programs and tools that we have precompiled for your use. You will see a few programs of interest here, such as `GATK`, `freebayes`, `snpEFF`. I want to briefly point out a few interesting locations:

    + __`/tools/BioBuilds-2014.04/bin`__: Most of the bioinformatics tools that you will need have been obtained through a software bundle called __`BioBuilds`__. Inside this directory is a `bin` directory that contains a bunch of executables for many common bioinformatics tools. If you want, you can look at inside and see what is available. In practice though, you should never really need to physically look around in here. If you want to know if a particular program is available, such as the BWA aligner, the easiest thing to do is to use the `which` command. 
```
which bwa
```
    + __`/tools/BioBuilds-2014.04/share/java`__: One of the more useful utilities included in BioBuilds is `picard`. It is a java script `jar` file, which means that it executes a little differently than other programs. It has to be called from `java` and you will have to supply the full path to it. So in case you are wondering, here is how you call picard:
```
java -jar /tools/BioBuilds-2015.04/share/java/picard/picard.jar
```
    + __`/tools/references`__. As you saw in the Course 1 exercises, this directory contains reference sequences and genome annotations for a number of model organisms. If there are additional tools or references that you think you may need frequently and that could be of interest to others generally, you can request that they be added by sending an email to ResearchScientificComputing@seattlechildrens.org.


* __`/data`__ The data directory provides some local scratch space for users. The term __"local"__ just means that that space is physically located on the computer you are using. Therefore the read/write speed to this disk is relatively fast compared to a mounted (remote) file system. The term __"scratch space"__ means that the space is not intended to keep anything permanently. It is a temporary holding spot. The data directory provides you a convenient local place to temporarily stash files that you are actively working on. When you are done with them, they should be moved elsewhere to free up this space for others. The `/data` directory provides 2 TB of shared space. __Note: You should not use your `home` directory for scratch space. Use `/data` instead.__ 

***
####  <span style="color:blue">__Exercise L3:__</span>
* Using the `which` command, discover if the tools `tophat` and `velvet` are available.
* Navigate to `/data`. Feel free to make a new directory there with your user id. <Hint: use the `mkdir` command.>

*** 

### The best place to read and write
You may be asking "If I can't stash stuff in my home directory because it's too small and the data directory is only for scratch space, then where am I supposed to store my stuff?" The answer is that this is the intended use of your departmental share drives. These drives can be mounted (or mapped to use the Windows phrase) on the linux system and accessed directly. __The best practice for doing work on these machines is to read from and write directly to your departmental share drives.__

In order to accomplish this, we have written a helper program that will mount the share for you.

# Miscellaneous review

### __`cat`__ vs __`less`__
Both of these functions will open up a file and display it's contents. What is the difference between the two and when should you use one over the other?

* `cat` opens a file and traverses row by row, sending the row's contents to *standard output*, which means that unless otherwise specified, it gets dumped onto your screen. That usually isn't very helpful, especially if it's a really big file. This usually isn't the best way to just take a peak. Typically, use `cat` when you want to stream the contents of the file row by row into some other function that will transform the data. 

* `less` allows you to open a file, but it only shows you the first page. Because it doesn't ever load the whole thing into memory, it is a great way to 'take a peak' inside a very big text file. As you scroll down, it quietly loads more into the memory as needed. Notice that `less` opens an actual program. Unlike `cat` you actually have to quit the program to get back to the command prompt.

### Choosing command flags, parameters, and using `--help`
The behavior of each command can be modified by setting different parameters. Most commands have a default parameter setting that runs when nothing is specified. But this can be modified by specifying different options, parameters or settings. 

* __flags__ are typically options that you can set to turn certain behaviors on or off. Because they are typically yes/no, they don't require any further arguments. In linux, flags are set using the minus sign `-` and are typically followed by a letter. You can set multiple flags at once by specifying multiple letters after the `-`. There's often a longform version of flags that is set using the double minus sign `--` followed by a word. The double minus usually distinguishes between a longform flag vs a set of multiple flags.
```
ls
ls -a
ls -l
ls -al
ls --all
```

* __parameters__ are special flags that require some additional input. For instance, you could specify the name of an input file or search string. Parameters are also typically designated with the minus sign `-` followed by a letter, `=` (or sometimes a space), and parameter value. As above, sometimes the parameter is designated with a word rather than a single letter. In this case, you would usually use a double minus `--`. (Just be aware that the double minus thing isn't a hard fast rule!)
```
cd /
ls --ignore=tools
```

* __`--help`__ is how you find out what flags and parameters are available and how you use them.
```
ls --help
```

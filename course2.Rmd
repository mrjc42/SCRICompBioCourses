Welcome to the second course in our series of courses designed to help train Biologists who want to be able to analyze their own data.  This course will introduce you to the experience of using high level interactive programming languages and specifically: to R.  In this class we will be introducing you to the language as a tool that you can use to explore data.  The course after this will attempt to teach you enough to actually get started with writing your own scripts etc.
